issues:
  - |
    When executing a deployment which includes the telemetry systems
    (ceilometer, gnocchi, aodh), the repo build will fail due to the
    inability for pip to read the constraints properly from the
    extras section in ceilometer's setup.cfg. The current workaround
    for this is to add the following content to
    ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

       repo_build_upper_constraints_overrides:
         - gnocchiclient<3.0.0
